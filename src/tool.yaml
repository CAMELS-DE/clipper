    title: HYRAS clip and preprocessing tool for CAMELS-DE dataset
    description: | 
      This tool can be used to clip catchments from the HYRAS dataset of the DWD (german weather service).
      The tool operates on a private copy of HYRAS stored in Google cloud storage and will upload the 
      processed slices to the same GCE project. The tool is optimized for Google Cloud Run, but can also
      be run locally.
    parameters:
      catchment_id:
        type: string
        description: | 
          The catchment ID to be processed. It needs to be contained in the source referred to by
          'catchments' in a column called 'id'. You might need to add that column.
      catchments:
        type: string
        description: | 
          The catchments to be processed. This can be the path to one of the files in the cloud drive or
          a local path within the container. It defaults to a local copy of the MERIT hydro catchments for
          Germany.
